## Welcome to my Final Project! This project analyzes Georgia's 2023 Seat Belt Survey data for adults.

### How to build the report and what to expect
- In order to produce the final report, use the provided makefile by typing "make" in the 
RStudio terminal and the report will automatically build. The report should contain an 
introduction with a description of the data and aims of the project, descriptive statistics 
in the form of a table one, and a figure displaying the proportion of belted vehicle 
occupants by weather condition. 

### Where to locate the code for the table and figure
- All code is stored in the "Code" subfolder relative to the project root folder.
The code for table one is in rscript file "TableOne.R", and the code which produces 
figure one is in rscript file "Figure1.R".

### Starting Clean
- Utilize the makefile by typing "make clean" in the Rstudio terminal to remove all of
the generated files.
